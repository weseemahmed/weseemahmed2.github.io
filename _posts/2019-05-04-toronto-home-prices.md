## Toronto home prices by neighbourhood, using Uber's WebGL Javascript library

Toronto is notorious for sky high prices so I decided to see just how high they reach with a 2.5D visualization. I use two data sources: <a href = "http://maps.library.utoronto.ca/cgi-bin/files.pl?idnum=151"> a shapefile of Toronto's neighbourhoods </a>, 
and a list of <a href = "https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/"> home prices per each
neighbourhood</a>. 

### Code

First I read in the shapefile data as a polygon (personal preference, I think it looks cooler in the plot), followed by the home price data.
Make sure to change the `Neighbourhood ID` column name to just `ID` so we can merge it with the shapefile. Next, I modify `Home.Prices` by 
dividing by 50 just so that the columns we'll generate are not too high and difficult to visualize.

```r
# Need to transform coordinate system to 4326 to be compatible with WebGL.
tor_shape <- st_read(".../Toronto shapefiles") %>% st_transform(4326) 

tor_data <- read.csv(".../Toronto_econ_data.csv") 
tor_data$Home.Prices <- tor_data$Home.Prices/50

tor_mapdata <- merge(tor_shape, tor_data)
```

Once we have loaded in our files and merged them by `ID`, we are now ready to be plot.

```r
mapdeck(token=key, style = mapdeck_style("dark"), pitch = 45, location = c(-79.34, 43.71), zoom = 3) %>%
  add_polygon(data = tor_mapdata, layer_id = "polygon_layer", fill_colour = "Home.Prices", elevation = "Home.Prices",
              auto_highlight = T, tooltip = "Neighbourhood")
```
